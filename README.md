# QSNN
As AI pushes classical computing to its limits, brain-inspired and quantum paradigms promise more efficient, adaptive, and powerful computation. This project explores a hybrid neural engineering framework that combines spiking neural networks (SNNs) — mimicking the brain’s event-driven, energy-efficient processing — with quantum neural networks (QNNs). By leveraging quantum principles like superposition and entanglement alongside SNNs, it aims to unlock novel pattern-recognition capabilities.
